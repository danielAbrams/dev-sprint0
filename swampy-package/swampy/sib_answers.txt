# Text answers from Week 0

# Name:



Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer:

1. This imports everything under TurtleWorld. The use of * includes everything under a directory.

2. This sets world to an instance of TurtleWorld


3. Sets bob to be an instance of Turtle

4. Waits for the user to do do something. 





These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer:
Turt, lengthturt, and n.

Turt takes a turtle
Lengthturt takes an integer.
n takes an integer.

-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer:

I used fd and lt. 

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer:
polyline takes t (of type turtle), n (of type integer), length (of type integer), and angle (of type float).




Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer:


I would use FD to move the turtle to the location of the circumference and then I would use lt(t, 90.0) to have it face the direction of circumference.

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer:
When it was done drawing the circle I would have the turtle LT(90) and then I would have it move forward by the radius. I would then have it LT 180 to be facing the direction it originally started.


-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer:
This is a postcondition requirement
